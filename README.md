## Basic Operations

These exercises focus on fundamental operations in Java, such as arithmetic operations, checking conditions, and more.

- **Sum of Two Numbers**: Calculate the sum of two numbers.
- **Odd or Even**: Check if a given number is odd or even.
- **Divisible by 5**: Check if a given number is divisible by 5.

## Control Statements

These exercises are designed to help you practice decision-making and looping constructs in Java.

- **Prime Number Check**: Check if a given number is prime.
- **Alphabet or Digit**: Determine if a given character is an alphabet or digit.
- **Provident Fund Calculation**: Calculate the provident fund (PF) based on the basic salary.

## Arrays

These exercises focus on operations related to arrays, including sorting, searching, and manipulating array elements.

- **Print Elements**: Print all elements of an array.
- **Reverse Array**: Reverse the elements of an array.
- **Find Minimum and Maximum**: Find the minimum and maximum values in an array.

## String Methods

Practice using various string methods in Java to manipulate and analyze strings.

- **Convert Integer to String**: Demonstrate the use of the `valueOf()` method.
- **Check String Start**: Check if a string starts with a specific character using the `startsWith()` method.
- **Trim Whitespace**: Remove leading and trailing spaces from a string using the `trim()` method.

## String Manipulation

These exercises cover advanced string manipulation tasks such as reversing strings, checking for palindromes, and more.

- **Combine Strings**: Write a program to combine two strings.
- **Reverse String**: Reverse a given string.
- **Anagram Check**: Check if two strings are anagrams.

## OOP Concepts

Practice object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts including inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and more.

- **Person Class**: Create a Java class called `Person` with attributes for name and age.
- **Animal Inheritance**: Design a base class `Animal` with a method `makeSound()` and create subclasses `Dog` and `Cat`.
- **BankAccount Encapsulation**: Implement a class `BankAccount` with private attributes and public methods to manage the account.
